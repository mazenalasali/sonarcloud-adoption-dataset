# SonarCloud Adoption Dataset

## Description

This dataset contains longitudinal monthly metrics collected from 82 open-source GitHub projects before and after adopting SonarCloud, an automated static analysis tool. The dataset was created to support empirical research on how SonarCloud adoption affects issue resolution efficiency, pull request processing, developer engagement, and workflow dynamics.

The dataset was used in the following study:

> [The Impact of Static Analysis on Open Source Software Development Practices]  
> [Mazen Al-Asali, Mohammed El-Ramly], [2025]

## Dataset Structure

Each row represents aggregated monthly metrics for a single project over two observation periods:
- **Before adoption:** at least 12 months prior to SonarCloud adoption
- **After adoption:** at least 12 months following SonarCloud adoption
